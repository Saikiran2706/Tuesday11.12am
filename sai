vim file for test
Once we install git , we need to initialize git using the command
-> git init

command to list the files
-> ls
 > ls-l ( to check the permissions and the files in the directory)
 > ls -a ( to check the hidden files in the directory)

To check the status of git
 > git status

To create a file in git
 > touch filename ( touch abc)

To create multiple files
 > touch file1 file2 file3 ( have to enter the file names with a space )

To enter the content in the file
 >vim filename ( vim abc ) or cat >> filename (cat >> abc)
 we can enter the content by clicking shift+i that moves to insert mode in git , once done with the completion of the content we can press esc :wq which saves and exits the file )
